    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",

    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "in a relational database with multiple tables,  primary key is the index of current table, and foreign key is the column that the other table is connected with the current table. \n",

    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line: Relationships can be one to one , one to many or many to many. example for one to one; a class and classpet table.  , one to many could be a customer table and  order table,  a customer can make multiple orders. Many to many,   a class and students for collage, students can enroll to multiple classes, and a class has multiple students. \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line: There are, full , left , right, and inner.\n",
    "Inner returns records that have matching values in both tables\n",
    "Left feturns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table\n",
    "Right returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table\n",
    "Full returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
